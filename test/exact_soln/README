When setting up the exact_soln tests to use the generic_exact_solution_testing_app,
there are a couple of important points to implement.

1. We are assuming that the primary libMesh::System name is "GRINS-TEST", so
   be sure to set the system_name variable to 'GRINS-TEST' in the test input file.

2. These tests are meant to operate by running the grins app directly, which will write
   out a restart file. Then, the genenric test app will run and load the restart file
   to compare against the exact solution (supplied on the command line). To maintain
   the integrity of the parallel builds, each restart file *must* be named uniquely.
   Thus, the rule here is to name the restart file the same as the test, e.g.
   if the test was named navier_stokes_2d.sh, then the restart should be named
   navier_stokes_2d.xda.gz.

3. If you're exact solution is a time-dependent one, you must evaluate it at the time
   the restart is written. You can do this in the parsed function, e.g.:
   
   'tf:=1.0;x+y+z+tf'

   This function will be parsed as x+y+z+1
