 Multigrid Examples
====================

These examples demonstrate the utilization of Geometric Multigrid on
some benchmark problems. The first, run_poisson.sh, demonstrates
vanilla multigrid usage for a forced Poisson problem with homogeneous
boundary conditions. Next, run_stokes.sh demonstrates the coupling
between fieldsplit and multigrid capabilities by applying multigrid
directly to the velocity sub-block of a lid driven cavity Stokes flow
formulation. Finally, the thermo coupled flow example demonstrates
recursive fieldsplit capabilities as well as the ability to do GMG on
multiple subblocks via two different sets of solver configurations.

These examples contain a set of default solver settings which perform
adequately, but a large variety of further options can be employed to
further customize the solve. The single required option is
-pc_mg_levels which must be specified at all times in order to dictate
the number of multigrid levels. Options such as
-pc_mg_distinct_smoothup for use to specify the up/down solve
separately, -pc_mg_cycles to select v or w cycles, -pc_mg_type for
additive, multiplicative or full multigrid types, and
-mg_{coarse,levels}_{pc,ksp}_* to configure the PC/KSP object for the
smoothing are commonly employed and can be used with appropriate
fieldsplit prefixes; for a full list of available solver options
please refer to the PETSc documentation.
