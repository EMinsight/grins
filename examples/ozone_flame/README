This examples shows cold start a simple ozone flame and run it to steady state.
In particular, we leverage the capability to override options in the input file
at the command line. This way, for all the timestepping runs, we can reuse the
same input file and only update the options we wish. Switching to a steady state
solve changes a few more options, so we use a separate input file for that.
Running the run.sh script with `export GRINS_RUN="mpiexec -np 16` on a Haswell
workstation with 16 cores takes a little over an hour. We also provide the file
restart.xdr so you can directly execute the steady state, restarting from the
same time instance you'd hit in the run.sh script. Note the mesh is very coarse,
the idea is to get to steady state where we can then leverage adaptive mesh
refinement to better resolve the calculation.
